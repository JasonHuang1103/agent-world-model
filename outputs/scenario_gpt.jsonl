Core entities include swipes/likes, matches, conversations (message objects with delivery/read timestamps), and blocks/reports. Date-planning features CRUD date ideas (categories, budgets), availability windows, and RSVP confirmations. Safety tools manage shareable date details (trusted contact, check-in timers), incident reports, and moderation actions (warnings, suspensions). Monetization metadata includes subscription plans, boosts, and purchase receipts. Workflows are rich: like → match → chat → plan date, plus spam/fraud queues and identity verification steps. This scenario is highly suitable for synthetic APIs because it relies on structured user data, state transitions, and messaging metadata rather than content-heavy media or AI inference."}
{"name": "Asana-Style Cross-Functional Project Hub", "description": "A project and work-management platform optimized for synthetic API simulation because the core value is structured CRUD on work items and permissions.
